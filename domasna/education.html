        <h4>Primary School</h4>
        <p>The process of my education started back in the year 2010. I started Primary School at OOU "Blaze Koneski" in
            Aerodrom Municipality. I finished primary education in 2019, as an excellent student, and for a long time I
            was thinking about where to continue my education. </p>

        <div class="balet">
            <img src="kazuo-ota-CGUZHPQ0l2c-unsplash.jpg" alt="Ballet">
            <h4>Ballet School</h4>
            <p>When I was around 7 years old, I attended ballet classes at DMBUC "Ilija Nikolovski - Luj" in Skopje. Ballet was my passion and everyday I was so excited to go to class. I was dancing for 8 years, up until I finished primary school. </p>
            <p>In those years, we had many concerts and competitions all over Macedonia. Each season there was a finishing concert where we would present the dances and the things we learned through the year.</p>
            <p>I have earned many diplomas, certificates and medals, and I'm so proud of everything we had achieved as a team.</p>

        <div class="sredno">
            <img src="shubham-sharan-Z-fq3wBVfMU-unsplash.jpg" alt="High school">
            <h4>High School</h4>
            <p>In the end, however, I decided that SUGS "Rade Jovcevski - Korcagin", was the best option. So I started high
                school in 2019, and was very happy because I knew I made the right decision.</p>
            <p>In the third year of secondary school, I took part in "Imam Stav". An activity supported by the Assembly of
                Macedonia. In the final we competed with two other schools, and we won the second place. Overall high
                school, was a nice experience and I also learned a lot. </p>

            <h4>University</h4>
            <p>In the last year of high school I was sure I wanted to continue my education studying about technology and computer science. So the decision was easy, I applied to the Faculty of Cpm[uter Science and Engineering (FINKI). I was so happy to get into my dream university.</p>
            <p>I'm finishing my first year, but I can say that I really like it and in the future, I wish to continue working in this field.</p>
